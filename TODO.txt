#

#	To do :
#	~~~~~~~
#
#	- implement a configuration file (~/.hl.cfg)
#	  in which names could define the options passed to hl,
#	  => no need to write multiple scripts such as those in
#	     example_scripts
#
#	  => write a parser in lex/yacc to parse the config file
#
#	- define the syntax for the selection of the configuration
#	  to use with hl,
#	  for example :
#		hl -Kr ip -Kg mac -Kc iface
#		(-K for Keyword ???)
#		(-Kr => red, -Kg => green, -Kc => cyan)
#	  or :
#		hl -S ifconfig
#		hl -S diff
#		hl -S ethtool
#		(-S for Standard configuration ???)
#
