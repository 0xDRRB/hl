Welcome to the **hl wiki** !

**hl** is a simple command that colorizes strings with basic terminal colors according to regular expressions.
It can be used to highlight log files, configuration files, output of various commands, and so on. It is also helpful to locate useful informations in a screen full of text.
hl can handle 42 colors.
Thanks to configuration files, the syntax of the **hl** command is considerably simplified.

**hl** is a command that can colorize texts such as text files, log files, or command outputs.
To use it on your system, you need to download the source files : 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mbornet-hl/hl
```
then compile them : 
```
$ cd hl
$ make clean; make
```
You should get a result like the following one : 
```
rm -f hl src/hl src/*.o
cd src; make
cc    -c -o cr_main.o cr_main.c
cc    -c -o cr_gpri.o cr_gpri.c
lex  -t cr_lex.l > cr_lex.c
cc    -c -o cr_lex.o cr_lex.c
./hl: version 1.91
rm cr_lex.c
mv src/hl .
./hl -V
./hl: version 1.91
make: [hl] Error 1 (ignored)
```
The generated **hl** file contains the executable binary file.
On Linux, you can check the file type with the following command : 
```
$ file hl
```
and the result should look like : 
```
hl: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.26, BuildID[sha1]=0x5f54d27c095ef7fabb9b19279f73c40cae1e6650, stripped
```
On macOS, you should get something like : 
```
hl: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```
Once you have got your **hl** executable, you can copy it into a directory which is in your PATH environment variable, for example : 
```
# cp hl /usr/local/bin
```
or : 
```
$ cp hl $HOME/bin
```
You can check you can access the command with : 
```
$ hl -V
```
and it should display the command's version, like : 
```
hl: version 1.91
```
Then you can copy configuration files in their own directories : 
```
# cp config_files/hl /etc/default
```
and : 
```
$ cp config_files/.hl.cfg $HOME
```
or copy the files from the **config_files** directory to any place you want on your system, as long as you define the environment variables **HL_CONF** and **HL_CONF_GLOB** to describe your configuration environment, for example :
``` 
export HL_CONF='/DATA3/projets/hl/config_files:/home/machine/mb:/etc/default/hl'
export HL_CONF_GLOB='hl_*.cfg:hl.cfg:.hl_*.cfg:.hl.cfg:hl_*.config'
```

Once this is done, you can use the configurations defined in the configuration files, by simply placing their name after a double dash, like : 
```
$  xxd hl | hl --xxd
```
You can test your own regular expressions using the options on the command line, like : 
```
$ echo "starting / stopping" | hl -ei -3g '(start(ing|ed))' -2r '(stop(ping|ped))'
```
and once you have got a set of options that suits your needs, you can create a configuration in your $HOME/.cfg file to simplify your command line options.

If you understand french, you can read the following item :

Man pages displayed by the man command can be colorized using the script hl_man as a pager. For example, you can set the **MANPAGER** variable like this :
```
$ export MANPAGER='/usr/local/bin/hl_man'
```
then use the man command as usual.

Now, you can define your own configurations using simple text strings or regular expressions and boldly go where no developer has gone before !
